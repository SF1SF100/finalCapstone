## Finance Calculator
I have created a simple finance calculator that offers two calculations:
1) An ROI calculation (showing users the amount of interest gained on an investment if using the simple or compounded method).
2) A loan calculation (showing users the amount they would have to repay on a home loan).

## Installation
You will need a Python programming language reader/compiler such as *Visual Studio Code* by Microsoft. You can find this software by clicking on the following link:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download (please follow the options on the website).

## Usage
The program has clear steps that you will need to follow. You are guided through each step until completion
Please see screenshot for example of use
